A Python scripting library for constructing Earth Engine API requests from simple primitives, and tools for interacting with the Earth Engine REST API.

_**Important Note: Access to Google Earth Engine is currently only available to trusted testers.  The Python API is in active development, and users should expect the API to change.  When (not if) API changes occur, applications that use the API will likely need to be updated.**_
