# Introduction #

The page gives an overview of installing the Google Earth Engine Python API.

# Ubuntu Linux Installation #


## Python 2.6+ ##

Linux users will already have Python installed. You can check the version of Python that is installed by running the following command:

```
python --version
```

If you are using Python 2.5 or Python 3, you will need to also install Python 2.6 or 2.7.


## PIP ##

[PIP](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is a package manager for Python. The following installation instructions assume that you are using the  Python package manager. Pip can be installed with the following command:

```
sudo apt-get python-pip
```

## Google APIs Client Library for Python ##

The Google APIs Client Library for Python provides support for authenticating to the Earth Engine servers. The library can be installed from the Python Package index by running the following command:

```
pip install google-api-python-client
```

Alternatively, the library can be built from the source code, available on Github at: https://github.com/google/google-api-python-client

## OpenSSL ##

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements Secure Sockets Layer protocol. To check if the OpenSSL library is installed on your system, run the following command, which will print the version of the library:

```
openssl version
```

On Ubuntu/Debian systems, the library can be installed by running the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install openssl
```


## pyOpenSSL ##

pyOpenSSL is a Python wrapper for the OpenSSL library. The pyOpenSSL library can be installed from the Python Package Index by running the following command:

```
pip install 'pyOpenSSL>=0.11'
```

Alternatively, the library can be built from the source code, available on Github at: https://github.com/pyca/pyopenssl


## pyCrypto ##

The pyCrypto library can be installed from the Python Package Index by running the following command:

```
pip install pyCrypto
```

To verify that the pyCrypto library has been installed correctly, run the following command.

```
python -c "from oauth2client import crypt"
```

If no error is returned, the library has been correctly installed.

## Earth Engine Python API ##

The Earth Engine Python library can be installed from the Python Package Index by running the following command:

```
pip install earthengine-api
```


### Installing manually from Source Code ###

To install the Earth Engine API manually, download a version of the package from the [PyPI download page](http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/e/earthengine-api/) and expand the archive file.

```
tar -zxvf earthengine-api-VERSION.tar.gz
```

Next switch into the expanded directory and run the setup script.
```
cd earthengine-api-VERSION
python setup.py install
```


# Mac OSX Installation #

# Uninstalling the Library #

## Uninstalling using the PIP package manager ##

To uninstall, simply run the following command.

```
pip uninstall google-api-python-client
```


## Uninstalling manually ##

The setup script installs numerous Python files.  To uninstall, simply find the files and remove them from your system.

On a Linux system, the package may be found here:
```
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/earthengine_api-0.0.1.egg-info
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ee/
```

## Uninstalling manually ##

The setup script installs numerous Python files.  To uninstall, simply find the files and remove them from your system.
On a Windows system, the package may be found here:
```
C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\earthengine_api-0.0.1-py2.7.egg
```

Note that the file locations may vary depending on you system configuration.

# Testing Out the Full Installation #

In order to test out installation, users first need to authenticate using OAuth 2.0.  Please see the Earth Engine API Docs for details.
